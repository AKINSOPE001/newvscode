    <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
    <P>Jollof rice, is a rice dish from West Africa.</P>
    <P>The dish is typically made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, chilies, onions, spices,<br> and sometimes other vegetables and/or meat in a single pot, although its ingredients and preparation methods vary across different regions.</P>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large, ripe tomato, cored and quartered</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, seeded and roughly chopped</li>
        <li>1 whole habanero pepper, stem removed</li>
        <li>1 whole Fresno chili, or jalapeño, stem removed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice.</li>
        <li>Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.</li>
        <li>After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.</li>
